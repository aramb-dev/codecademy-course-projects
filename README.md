# Codecademy Course Projects
### by Abdur-Rahman Bilal
This repo consists of most projects from the [Full-Stack Engineer Codecademy Course](https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path-b/). Some projects are tweaked and changed into something better using my imagination, while others are partially completed websites/projects that I fully completed.

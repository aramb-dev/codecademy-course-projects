            New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens,
            Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the
            home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the
            City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is
            currently located on Liberty Island and commonly visited by
            tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn’t
            unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square.
            Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway
            shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was named after
            The New York Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior to
            that, it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for
            its bridges that connect the boroughs and allow ease of
            transportation.

# The Summit
## Time to put some navigation design knowledge to the test!

Your goal is to improve the user experience of this ski lodge landing page.

Currently, none of the clickable elements are very clear or offer good visual feedback to users.

The exact implementation and styling will be up to you; take the opportunity to be creative in your designs!

Keep in mind that slick styling is cool, but it is just as important to clearly demonstrate to users how to interact with the site.
